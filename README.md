# BdB Angular Template

This directory is a brief example of an [Angular](https://angular.io/) app that can be used for the companie's products.

## Build It For Your Own Team

Right after your new repository has been created based on this template, you need to include the project name inside it.

For that, go ahead and **Find and Replace** _"bbog-dig-angular-template-web-ui"_ with whatever is your new project repo name. Something like _"bbog-something-web-ui"_.

Up until this point, you're ready to start working on your development.

## The _"config.yml"_ file

Before you start making commits and make CircleCI fail because of CI configurations, make sure your team DevOps or most experienced developer validates the contents in the `config.yml` file. 

Please. PLEASE. Do not start building CircleCI jobs until you have a `config.yml` file configured for your team's AWS environment.
